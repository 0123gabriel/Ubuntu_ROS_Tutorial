# Packing a Customed CARLA Simulator

Packaging your project creates a distributable package for distributing your Unreal Game project to users. The overall process of packing consist in compile the project-specific source code, and then all the necessary content is converted or "cooked" into a format that can be used on the target platform. Next, the compiled code and cooked content are packaged together in a distributable package file, such as a Windows installer.

The advantages of creating a package for distribution versus running the CARLA simulator through the Unreal Editor include a faster and easier launch, the ability to distribute the CARLA simulator with custom vehicles and maps, and a smaller footprint. Packaging a project in CARLA Simulator involves the following steps.

1. Default game map configuration
2. Update map list
3. Other packaging options
4. Packaging
